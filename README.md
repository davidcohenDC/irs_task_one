# Overview
This project combines light-seeking and obstacle-avoidance behaviors in a footbot robot. 
The robot navigates towards a light source while avoiding collisions with obstacles. 

The maximum wheel velocity is 15 units.

## Tasks
- **Light-Seeking:** Move towards a light source using light sensors.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Use proximity sensors to avoid collisions.
- **Random Walk:** Perform random movements when no light or obstacles are detected.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Time to Reach the Light**
- **Frequency of Reaching the Light**
- **Final Distance to the Light**
